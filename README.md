# LearningCurve
 A set of projects to help myself and others learn.

- Threads
Creating a Threads-like app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) plus NextJS.

This project will have multiple branches, here is how I intend to set these up.
Branch 01 - Project Intro And Setup
Branch 02 - Authentication
So on and so forth.

I am learning while doing this, if there are mistakes, please let me know.

For this project, I am following a video from JavaScript Mastery, you can follow it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5cmLDVTgAs
